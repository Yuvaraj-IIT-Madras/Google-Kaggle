For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n","\n","* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n","* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n","* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n","\n","\n","## For help\n","\n","**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n","\n","### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n","\n","In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).

Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n","\n","AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n","\n","If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"830cb0d4","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e322257a-3d3a-4af4-8bfc-4a73845e6c49","_uuid":"93cb0a55-d8ea-4aa1-94dc-c6fe1ccb1d6c","collapsed":false,"id":"f00ea7c99e44","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":0.01286,"end_time":"2024-11-21T06:21:04.602052","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-11-21T06:21:04.589192","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n","\n","If this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!
