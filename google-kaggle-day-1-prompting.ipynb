You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"_uuid":"817bd87f-3da7-4f9a-9dd6-3dc2562ba68b","_cell_guid":"482a481e-d68c-4bdf-8288-3be398000c7a","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"id":"csNPnkuCobmG","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

He preferred the comfort of his sunbeam, the rhythm of his owner's heartbeat, and the endless supply of catnip. Yet, one fateful Tuesday, his life took a turn towards the unknown.\n\nIt began with a rogue feather, blown in from the open window. Bartholomew, a creature of habit, always sat on the same windowsill. This feather, a vibrant blue, landed directly on his head, prompting a startled leap. He landed, not on his usual spot, but on the windowsill next door. \n\nAnd there, gazing at him with wide, emerald eyes, was a beautiful calico cat named Clementine.  She was unlike any cat Bartholomew had ever seen. She had a mischievous twinkle in her eye, a sly grin, and a daring streak that made his whiskers twitch with curiosity.\n\n\"Come with me,\" Clementine purred, beckoning with a flick of her tail. \"There's a whole world out there, waiting to be explored!\"\n\nBartholomew, usually a creature of routine, found himself inexplicably drawn to her. He followed her out the window, into the unfamiliar world beyond. \n\nTheir adventure led them through rustling gardens, across bustling streets, and into the heart of the city. They chased pigeons in the park, climbed fences, and even snuck into a bakery, where they feasted on crumbs and cream. \n\nThe world, Bartholomew discovered, was a symphony of smells and sounds, a labyrinth of textures and sensations. Every corner held a new discovery, a new thrill. Clementine, a seasoned adventurer, guided him with her daring and grace.\n\nBut their journey was not without its dangers. A grumpy bulldog with a deep growl tried to chase them, a nosy chihuahua barked threats from a rooftop, and even a flock of pigeons seemed to take offense to their presence.\n\nBut Clementine, with her quick reflexes and cunning strategy, always found a way to escape. And Bartholomew, inspired by her spirit, learned to navigate the world with a newfound confidence.\n\nFinally, after a day filled with excitement and challenges, their adventure led them back to Bartholomew's window. He looked at his comfortable sunbeam, the familiar rhythm of his owner's heartbeat, and the endless supply of catnip, with a renewed appreciation. \n\nBut something had changed. The world, once a mundane routine, was now a canvas of possibilities. He knew, with a certainty that surprised him, that he wouldn't be content with simply sitting in the sunbeam anymore.\n\nHe gave Clementine a grateful purr, and with a knowing wink, she disappeared into the night, leaving Bartholomew with a whisper of a promise – “There's always another adventure waiting, just beyond the window.” And Bartholomew, for the first time in his life, was ready to explore it. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

This is particularly helpful when working on multiple projects simultaneously.
